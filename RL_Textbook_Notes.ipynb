    "***k-armed Bandit Problem***: Analogy of having several attempts at a slot machine with k levers. Each of the levers has an expected or mean reward value we receive if we decide to pull it (select lever 5 as our action at timestep 3 for example). The action selected at timestep t is denoted as A_t, the reward from this action is denoted as R_t, our arbitary action select as a, and the expected reward formula is thus: q*(a) = E[R_t | A_t = a]\n",
    "\n",
    "***Exploration vs Exploitation***: This is a tradeoff in RL, exploration is trying out new levers (with a potentially lower expected reward) with the hopes that we receive a much higher reward. Exploitation is using our current knowledge of expected rewards and selecting the action with the highest expected reward. We use different models to switch between these two efforts when we have our agent work through our map trying to collect rewards.\n",

    "***Sample-average***: Sampling method for creating an expected value estimate on an action. This method is simply the average reward value of the action up to this point.

    "***epsilon-greedy methods***: methods that have a preset variable value epsilon that represents a probability that our agent will select an action randomly (all actions with equal probability) instead of the action that has the highest expected reward. Ex: eps=0.5 for the case of two actions at timestep 1: 50% chance of selecting action with highest expected prob and 50% chance of selecting randomly between action 1 and 2 (thus 0.50 + 0.25 = 0.75 chance we select the greedy option (excercise 2.1)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage of eps-greedy over greedy depends on the task. For example, if the rewards have higher variance then it takes more exploration to find the true best rewards. If there is no variance then no exploration is needed and we can just do greedy. Can also run into ***nonstationary tasks*** where the true reward value of an action changes over time.\n",

We can change our stepsize function from the sample average function alpha(a) = (1/n) to a constant value alpha: alpha(a) = alpha. The sample average stepsize is gauranteed to converge to the true mean expected value while the constant value isnt. This is good becuase we dont want convergence on an expected value that is constantly changing.\n",

This encourages the agent to explore more at the start which can help for stationary problems. (Doesnt for non stationary as eventually expected reward will change and the inital reward values wont matter)."

    "Planning vs Learning: \"From an MDP standpoint, planning is about coming up with the policy that maximizes expected long-term rewards. Learning is about estimating the transition probabilities, and sometimes the reward distribution for each transition.\"\n",

    "**Model-learning**: Using the rewards and states observed (known as real experience) by a planning agent to improve our model of the enviornment. Meaning we use our samples to improve p(s', r | s, a). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Direct reinforcement learning**: Using the rewards and states observed to improve our state-value functions and policy. Known as direct due to using real experience to directly improve our value functions and policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "model learning is known as an indirect RL method as by improving our model we indirectly improve our value functions and policy due to both of them using the model in their calculations.\n",

    "**Search control**: Selecting starting states and actions as simulated experiences for training a model. For example, for Random-sample one-step tabular Q-planning has the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Select a state, s in S, and an action, a in A(s), at random \n",
    "    2. Send s, a to a sample model, and obtain a sample next reward, r, and a sample next state, s' \n",

    "Dyna-Q vs regular Q-learning: Both algorithms start out with an intial step of starting at a state in the enviornment and taking a real life step to observe a reward. The difference is that Q-learning will stop after this step do its value calculations and then repeat, while Dyna-Q stores this real life result in a table and then performs simulation steps based on the table info to do further calculations.

    "**Dyna-Q+**: Dyna-Q with an added heuristic that helps the agent explore states that havent been explored in a while. The heuristic adds more reward to the states based on for how many timesteps they havent been explored. The reward calculation is as follows: r + k*sqrt(t) where t is the number of timesteps that a state hasnt been visited. This method helps an agent explore new paths that could be better solutions than the one it currently has. "
